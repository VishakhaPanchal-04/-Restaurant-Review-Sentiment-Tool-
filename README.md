•Dataset
The dataset consists of restaurant customer reviews collected from online sources. Each review is labeled with sentiment classes such as positive, negative, or neutral.

•Methodology
I cleaned and prepared the restaurant review text by removing unnecessary words and converting it into numerical features. These features were then used to train machine learning models that classify each review based on its sentiment.

•Results
The model successfully classifies restaurant reviews into sentiment categories with good accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of NLP techniques in analyzing customer feedback.
